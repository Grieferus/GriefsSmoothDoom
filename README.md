## Background
Back in 2018, I discovered Smooth Doom and I instantly fell in love with it, but weapon animations seemed a little bit choppy.

What started as a simple super shotgun animation improvement grew into constant seeking of ways to improve the mod.

## Changes
- Restored monster variations
- Removed ACS scripts for CVARs
- Added brightmaps for all sprites
- Added HD sounds, courtesy of PerKristian's HD sounds and Doom Sound Bulb
- Vastly improved animations for monsters and weapons
- Slight code refactoring
- Alpha-style movement and weapon bobbing
- Animated textures with brightmaps

# How to use
Make sure to set "View bob amount while moving" to 0.15 and "Weapon bob speed" to 1.6 in GZDoom's "display options". Additionally, you can set "Tonemap mode" to "Palette" in "OpenGL options" (In later versions, this option is in "Postprocessing" submenu).
